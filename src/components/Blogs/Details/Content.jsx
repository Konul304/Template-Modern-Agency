              We all intend to plan ahead, but too often let the
              day-to-day minutia get in the way of making a calendar for
              the year. Sure, you can't know every detail to anticipate.
              Heck, you can't know half the priorities that will pop up
              in any particular month. But you can plan for big picture
              seasonality, busy-times, and events.
